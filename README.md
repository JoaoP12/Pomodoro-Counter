# Pomodoro Counter

## About
The aim of the project is just to practice Vanilla JavaScript, time handling, desktop notifications and to create my own Pomodoro Counter with features that fit my needs, and of course that can be easily modified to fit other people's needs too.

## Getting Started

Nothing more than a browser is needed to run the project.
Just run:

```
git clone https://github.com/JoaoP12/Pomodoro-Counter.git
```
Then open the ```index.html``` file and you're good to go.

If everything is working, you should see a page like this:

## Usage

After opening the page on your browser, the default focus, short and long break time will be loaded, but you can change it clicking on the Settings button and changing the values as you wish.

To start the timer, you can just hit the "Start" button.

## To do
- [ ] Implement the desktop notifications.
- [ ] Implement more settings.
- [ ] Make the page responsive.
- [ ] Change colors when alternating between focus time and breaks.
